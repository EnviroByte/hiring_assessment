   - B) The rate at which carbon prices increase annually
   - C) The rate at which monitoring equipment must be calibrated
   - D) The rate at which new technologies must be implemented

6. Which of the following is NOT typically included in a facility's regulated emissions calculation?
   - A) Combustion emissions from natural gas boilers
   - B) Process emissions from industrial operations
   - C) Employee commuting emissions
   - D) Vented emissions from equipment

## Compliance and Credit Systems

7. What is a "vintage year" in the context of carbon credits?
   - A) The year when a carbon credit expires
   - B) The year when a carbon credit was generated or issued
   - C) The year when a carbon credit was purchased
   - D) The year when a carbon credit was first regulated

8. What is "credit use limit" in a compliance system?
   - A) The maximum number of credits a facility can generate
   - B) The maximum percentage of compliance obligation that can be met with credits
   - C) The maximum price a facility can pay for credits
   - D) The maximum number of years credits can be carried forward

9. How is a facility's compliance obligation typically determined?
   - A) Based on historical emissions multiplied by a reduction factor
   - B) Based on the facility's maximum production capacity
   - C) Based on the average emissions of similar facilities
   - D) Based on a fixed cap set by the regulator

10. What happens when a facility exceeds its compliance obligation?
    - A) It must purchase additional credits or pay a compliance fee
    - B) It automatically receives additional credits for the next year
    - C) It must shut down until emissions are reduced
    - D) It must implement specific technology upgrades

## Regulatory Frameworks and Facility Classifications

11. What is a "large emitter" typically defined as in emissions regulations?
    - A) A facility that emits more than 10,000 tonnes of CO2e annually
    - B) A facility that emits more than 50,000 tonnes of CO2e annually
    - C) A facility with more than 100 employees
    - D) A facility with more than $10 million in annual revenue

12. What is an "aggregate facility" in the context of emissions reporting?
    - A) A facility that combines multiple emission sources under one report
    - B) A facility that processes aggregate materials like gravel
    - C) A facility that has been in operation for more than 10 years
    - D) A facility that has multiple owners

13. What is a "high-performance benchmark" used for?
    - A) Setting the minimum efficiency standard for new equipment
    - B) Determining the compliance obligation based on top performers
    - C) Ranking facilities by their emissions reduction achievements
    - D) Setting the carbon price in a specific market

## Data Analysis and Forecasting

14. What method is commonly used to forecast future emissions for a facility?
    - A) Simple extrapolation of historical emissions
    - B) Correlation with GDP growth projections
    - C) Modeling based on production forecasts and emission factors
    - D) Averaging the emissions of similar facilities

15. What is an "emission factor"?
    - A) A multiplier that converts activity data to emissions
    - B) The percentage by which emissions must be reduced
    - C) The ratio of direct to indirect emissions
    - D) The efficiency rating of emissions control equipment
