API endpoints for the compliance projection system.

This file serves as the main API router. Candidates should implement their
endpoints in the appropriate app directories:
- facilities/ - For facility-related endpoints
- emissions_api/ - For emissions data and calculation endpoints
- regulatory/ - For compliance and regulatory requirement endpoints

# 
# In facilities/api.py:
# - GET /facilities - List all facilities
# - GET /facilities/{facility_id} - Get details for a specific facility
#
# In emissions_api/api.py:
# - GET /facilities/{facility_id}/emissions - Get emissions data for a facility
#
# In regulatory/api.py:
# - GET /facilities/{facility_id}/compliance - Get compliance status for a facility
# - POST /compliance/calculate - Calculate compliance obligation
#
# Then import and include your router in this file, for example:
# from facilities.api import router as facilities_router
# api.add_router("/facilities/", facilities_router)
