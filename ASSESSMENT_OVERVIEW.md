- **Data Processing Exercise**: Jupyter notebook with exercises for processing and analyzing emissions data

### 2. Case Study
- **End-to-end Project**: A facility compliance projection system that integrates frontend, backend, and data processing
- **Scenario-based**: Practical application of both technical skills and domain knowledge

## How to Use This Assessment

1. **For Initial Screening**: Use the business logic assessment (quiz and data exercise) to evaluate candidates' domain knowledge.

2. **For Final Candidates**: Use the case study for a comprehensive evaluation of both technical skills and domain knowledge.

## Evaluation Process

We recommend the following evaluation process:

1. **Initial Review**: Have candidates complete the business logic assessment to ensure they have the necessary domain knowledge.

2. **Final Interview**: Have qualified candidates present their solution to the case study, focusing on their approach, design decisions, and understanding of the problem domain.

## Customization

This assessment package can be customized based on your specific needs:

- Adjust the difficulty level of the quiz questions
- Modify the data processing exercises to focus on specific skills
- Extend the case study with additional requirements
- Add or remove components based on the role requirements

## Next Steps

1. Review the assessment materials to ensure they align with your hiring needs
2. Set up a GitHub repository for candidates to fork and submit their solutions
3. Create an evaluation rubric for consistent assessment of candidates
4. Prepare instructions for candidates on how to submit their solutions
